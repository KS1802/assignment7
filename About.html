                 I am a First year Masters Student doing my <strong>Master of Science in Information Technology</strong> at the <strong>Business school, WPI</strong>. I have completed my <strong>B.E.Electronics Engineering </strong> from  <strong>D.J.Sanghvi from College of engineering,Mumbai University</strong> <br> 
<br>
                 During my Freshman year in my undergrad, I got in touch with a few sophomores and started a college literary society which focused on events like Quizez, Just a Minute events and Paper writing. I also tried out for the basketball team and the college Electronic rcaing team called DJS Thunderbolt which tales part in events like Formula Student and Formula Bharat and was an acitve member for both. In my sophomore year, I joined the college IEEE chapter, IEEE Brainwaves as a co-committee member and was an active part in that as well.
         My active participation in both led to me becoming a <strong>Vice chairperson in the college Literary Society(DJ LIT)</strong> and <strong>Secretary in the IEEE Brainwaves </strong> in my junior year. Due to the merger of the DJS Racing and the DJS Thunderbolt chapters I decided to leave the E racing team and focus my attention elsewhere. 
         Which is why in my junior year I became a Campus Ambassador for Viacom18 group which led to internships in companies like Grapevine which managed the campus Ambassador for Viacom18 and handled a few other clients. I was also selected as the Network or city head for the Mumbai Chapter of campus ambassadors of the Viacom18 group and had to manage roughly 120 students who worked as campus ambassadors under my supervision.

            My intrest in gaming piqued during my Sophmore year of undergrad and was lucky enough to be a member of a 50,000 strong group on Facebook comprising of gamers. I was soon a member of the admin panel in the group with the goal of improving the gaming community and making things more accesible for them. We started of small with tournaments and soon with the trust we built, a few friends from the admin team was able to establish a Gaming company called Elitehubs.
        We still had the same goal of helping the gamers in the community and that led to us growing as a company with having bigger tournaments in partnerships with companies like Nvidia and WD. That was my first interaction with data analysis as managing the group and helping the company needed me to be on top of the data and understand the needs of the market and the gamers. These were things that kept me occupied during my gap academic year. I also became a member of the Builders Association of Navi Mumbai(BANM) and was a committee member in their exhibition in December 2019.<br>

        I developed a love for the sport of chess back in my 2nd grade of sschool and started playing competitively soon. I was soon one of the best players in my locality and had a few tournaments with a near perefect record. I did have a perfect record in one of theschool torunaments remaing unbeaten by winning all of my games. I was selected to represent India in a inter school chess tournament organized in Russia by due to exams and a few health conditions in my family I was unable to play at that level in my middle school. I had to finally hang up my shoes from professional level chess tournaments when I got to play the State level tournament in my 9th Grade.<br>
    <br>
        I started playing basketball and following the NBA back in my 3rd grade. We had a really strong team and we consantly finished first and got to represent our city and go for the states. We won a state tournament in my 9th grade after we overcame a deficit of 17 points in the last quarter against the home team to win it all. The national tournaments had a limit of a maximum of 3 players per school in the state team which was built from the different schools participating in the state level tournament which led to me never being able to represent the state with a few teammates from the school going on to be selected for the india camp and getting a chance to represent the country. I still play basketball and am hopefull of being selected for the college club basketball team as a grad student.<br>
